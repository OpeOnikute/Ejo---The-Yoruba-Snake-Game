# Ejo---The-Yoruba-Snake-Game
Meet Ejo, He's a Yoruba snake who eats only eba and fufu. Let's build him together.

<h3>Game Info</h3>
The game currently consists of:
- One Snake eating eba. 
- A scoreboard
- Health bar: Essentially you'd have to eat yourself three times to die. But the bushes at the edge are poisonous so they drain all of Ejo's health.
- Bonuses for eating a particular amount 
- Exciting animations for a 2D game.
- A Pause menu
- An About Menu

<h3>How to install</h3>
The game was built on Python 2.78, but any latter version works. The required frameworks are Pygame (Python's game library), and Pyganim, (Pygame's animation framework). 
- Clone the repository, and run a 'pip install -r requirements.txt' to get the required modules installed on your OS.
- Move all the images into the same folder as the main.py file.
- Open the main.py file with any editor of your choosing and run the game. 

You could also create a <a href="https://www.google.com.ng/url?sa=t&rct=j&q=&esrc=s&source=web&cd=1&cad=rja&uact=8&ved=0ahUKEwjFi8XbrM_NAhWrCcAKHfXvCCgQFggcMAA&url=http%3A%2F%2Fdocs.python-guide.org%2Fen%2Flatest%2Fdev%2Fvirtualenvs%2F&usg=AFQjCNEvupNSRAVxfumkI5JFoxABd0GHhQ&sig2=HZIahDpW2zapyX1ZGp8C_g">virtualenv</a> with Python 2.78, then install Pygame and Pyganim in the environment to be safe.

<h3>Features to be added</h3>
<h4>Soundtrack</h4>
We've been looking for a proper soundtrack, which is ideally a fast-paced Fuji beat. If you have any, submit a pull request while re-working the code and adding sound if you know how to. If you don't submit a pull request with the link to the sound regardless.

<h4>Storyline</h4>
I'd like to have a storyline, which would ideally be an animation that plays when the user first plays the game. Send any ideas or write-ups to me through <a href="http://www.twitter.com/ope__o">Twitter</a>, or <a href="mailto:opeyemionikute@yahoo.com">my e-mail</a>. We'd find a way to incorporate the storyline into the game afterwards when we do the animation.
For example, "There is farmine in Abeokuta, and Ejo goes to Ibadan to gather all the Eba and fufu to take it back to his hometown. He has to also get tomatoes and grind pepper on his way back. But the citizens are afraid and want to kill him so he has to pass through the gutter. Ejo -- The Yoruba Hero."

<h4>Bonus Level</h4>
I've been dwelling on the idea of a bonus level or stage, maybe there'd be a buffet of Eba and Amala and Ejo gets to eat not only for the village, but for himself. It'll be a chance for the player to replenish health and reduced Ejo's length to ease game difficulty.

<h4>High Score</h4>
I just haven't gotten around to doing it yet.

That's pretty much it. Let's help make Ejo. I'd update this readme as the need arises.

<h4>Re-write in Javascript</h4>
Would be nice to have this on the browser.

### How to use
- Setup your virtualenv using instructions from [here](https://docs.python-guide.org/dev/virtualenvs/).
- In that environment, run `pip install -r requirements.txt`
